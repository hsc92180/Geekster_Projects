### HTML File:

This is index.html file. We use Link tag in head to connect css file with html file.
rel -> attribute tell about type of sheet we are calling and href -> attribute gives address of file.
In body, I have used main, section, svg, img, ul, li, i, img, heading, div, p tags with appropriate css styling.

### CSS File:

universal, class, and tag selector used in css. <br>
In css styling, common properties have been used as: <br>

padding -> used for giving space between content and border of the element.<br>
box-sizing -> property used for styling box like container for body.<br>
color -> used for giving color of text.<br>
border -> used for giving style to border. There are many propereties for border like border-style border-radius. <br>
background properties -> used for styling backgrund like color, image, position, repeat, etc.<br>
font-size -> used for giving size to the font. <br>
border-radius -> cornering the element border using it.<br>
display as grid -> property of display. <br>
grid-template-columns -> specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout. <br>
grid-template-rows -> specifies the number (and the widths) of rows in a grid layout. <br>
gap -> defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. <br>

I also used Tailwind CSS<br>
-Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. 
-It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
